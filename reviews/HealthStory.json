            "Our Review Summary": "The story focuses on a forthcoming study that aims to evaluate if virtual reality technology can be used to identify people who will eventually develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe story\u2019s headline states: \u201cVirtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d That is misleading. The researchers haven\u2019t even recruited study participants yet, much less conducted the study or analyzed the results. The story also fails to describe how potential diagnosis might work, what the technique may cost, or what risks are involved. It\u2019s also not clear whether any of the researchers have a potential conflict of interest. In short, the story raises far more questions than it answers. That\u2019s problematic.\n\u00a0",

            "Why This Matters": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease affects around 5 million Americans \u2014 and that number is expected to double by 2060. The disease adversely affects the quality of life for both patients and their loved ones, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. In short, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a big deal, and any new advances in risk assessment or diagnosis are newsworthy.\nHowever, because this is a subject that many people are passionate about, it is especially important to approach new research responsibly. In this instance, the study has not even taken place yet, and the story fails to answer most of the major questions one might have regarding Alzheimer\u2019s research.\nWe can understand that a research institution may want to raise awareness of a forthcoming study in order to recruit study participants. We are less clear on why a major news outlet would write about the research \u2014 which hasn\u2019t even taken place yet \u2014 as if it is already newsworthy and generating data that clinical decisions can be based upon."

                "answer": "Not Satisfactory",
                "explanation": "Cost is not discussed. And there are multiple costs to consider here: the cost of the virtual reality (VR) hardware itself, the cost of whatever software the study participants would be using, and the cost of training professionals to interpret the data generated by study participants using the virtual reality technology. (Note: we say \u201cstudy participants\u201d because there are no patients yet, but \u2014 ultimately \u2014 the cost to patients is what we\u2019d be interested in.)"

                "explanation": "This is tricky. The study has not yet taken place, so there are no benefits to discuss \u2014 which makes it difficult to ding the story for failing to quantify the benefits.

                "answer": "Not Satisfactory",
                "explanation": "The big risk here, as with any screening test, is incorrect results. Even if the study hasn\u2019t happened yet, and important data sets like sensitivity and specificity can\u2019t yet be quantified, they should be addressed in the story. What are sensitivity and specificity? Sensitivity measures how often a test correctly generates a positive result for people who have the condition that\u2019s being tested for. Specificity measures a test\u2019s ability to correctly generate a negative result for people who don\u2019t have the condition that\u2019s being tested for. In other words, there are two possible harms inherent in diagnostic and risk assessment tools: the failure to identify someone who has Alzheimer\u2019s; and the \u201cfalse positive\u201d misdiagnosis of people who do not have Alzheimer\u2019s. Either mistake can have significant costs \u2014 financial and personal \u2014 for patients."

How will the study assess a patient\u2019s navigation skills (which the point of using a VR device)? How will it distinguish between people whose navigation skills are poor because of early neural degeneration, versus people who have never been good at navigating? Is this a longitudinal study, with patients participating in the study over the course of years, coupled with long-term follow-up to determine if and when patients develop Alzheimer\u2019s or other, related conditions? Those are all good questions, and they are not answered here."

However, the only source cited in the story is one of the researchers who will be conducting the study. Input from an independent expert about the viability of such a study would have been very welcome."

                "explanation": "There is no discussion of other approaches that are used to identify people who have Alzheimer\u2019s disease among high-risk groups. There is also no acknowledgement of the fact that there is no definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease in patients while they are still alive (the only definitive diagnostic technique involves an autopsy). That\u2019s a heck of an oversight."

                "answer": "Not Satisfactory",
                "explanation": "On the one hand, the story does tell readers that there will be a forthcoming study to evaluate whether VR technology can be used to test people\u2019s navigation ability in order to determine whether it is an effective technique for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s. (In other words, they don\u2019t even know if this is something that will work yet.)\nOn the other hand, earlier in the story, readers run across sentences like: \u201cVirtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d and \u201cThose who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer\u2019s later in life, scientists now believe.\u201d That makes it sound like this is already a useful tool, and availability could be right around the corner. Ultimately, the story never explicitly tells readers that any possible VR tool is years away, at best. That tips the scales for us, and we lean in the direction of \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d on this criterion. One wonders how many people read this story and contacted their general practitioner about taking a VR test to assess their Alzheimer\u2019s risk."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?",
                "answer": "Not Satisfactory",
                "explanation": "The story does note that previous work has been done determining that navigational skills are an early indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s risk. However, the story makes it seem like the use of VR technology is what\u2019s new here. That\u2019s not true. We found studies using VR to assess issues related to navigation ability and Alzheimer\u2019s dating back to at least 2008 and 2009. So, what sets the forthcoming study apart? We wish the story had made that clear."

However, it could have explained that better: In the contraceptive research world, this generally means that the failure rate is 14 pregnancies per 100 women in a year. But researchers only studied the gel for seven menstrual cycles.\nThe story compares this pregnancy rate to a couple of of other forms of birth control, which is good, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that those failure rates have far more evidence behind them. The efficacy rate for this new product is based on just one industry study.\nAlso, the story makes a vague reference that the gel may kill \u201ccertain viral and bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted diseases.\u201d Only at the end of the story do we find out that researchers have no data yet for this claim."

                "explanation": "The story did explain that \u201cthe ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over 40, but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum.\u201d And it offered an estimated of 12% of couples with infertility problems."

                "explanation": "We\u2019ll award a hesitant satisfactory score for this criterion.\nThe fertility specialist who treated the woman profiled in the story was interviewed. \u00a0And so was another OB-Gyn, but no explanation was given of where she works or why she was chosen to be interviewed.\nSo we don\u2019t know if she\u2019s connected in some way with the fertility center in question."

                "explanation": "The fertility test in question was called a breakthrough. \u00a0But readers and viewers are given no evidence-based comparison between it and the countless other methods to try to help infertile couples."

            {
                "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?",
                "answer": "Not Satisfactory",
                "explanation": "The online text piece doesn\u2019t offer any information about how often this approach has been tried \u2013 or in how many settings. \u00a0Only that it hasn\u2019t been done \u201con many\u201d women.\nDoes that mean five times, 50? \u00a0In one setting, in 10?\nNeither readers nor viewers are given appropriate context.\nThere is little published information on DNA testing for endometrial receptivity and there is no test available for clinical use to my knowledge."
