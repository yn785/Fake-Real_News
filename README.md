# Fake-Real_News
It should be no surprise to us that while news sources provide most of the information we learn every day, it is questionable whether the news we read is credible and trustworthy. Differentiating legitimate and correct news articles
from ‘fake’ or misleading ones is an important task, raising the interest of journalists, policy makers and researchers in many fields such as social science and data science. Specifically in the context of health, the consequences of delivering illegitimate news can be paramount and irreversible.
In this assignment, we will be working on a dataset comprising more than 1,000 health-related news articles, the reviews of these articles, and tweets about the new articles.
Using this dataset, we will have an opportunity to learn how to identify ‘good’ and ‘bad’ news by characterising some linguistic patterns of news, as well as comparing different news outlets based on their correctness of reporting
